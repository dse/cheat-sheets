Okay...

1.  Your document HAS to be the size of a #10 business envelope. It's
    9.5″ W × 4.125″ H in case there's not an option for that and you
    need to do a custom setting. It's horizontal mode, not vertical
    mode, for the document. 9.5 inches WIDE. 4.125 inches HIGH.

2.  I used Inkscape to make an envelope PDF that size to print. If you
    don't want to go through that whole mess then I dunno find a
    Google Docs or Microsoft template or something, I can't help you
    there.

3.  You have to print using the system print dialog.

4.  In the system print dialog, click Preferences. That should bring
    up a print preferences dialog for your particular printer, that
    comes with your printer's driver.

5.  There should be a setting for Document Size or something like
    that. It relates to the original file. Change it to #10 business
    envelope.

6.  There should be a setting for Print On Paper Size or something
    like that. It relates to what you're printing it on.<br>Change it
    to #10 business envelope.

7.  Orientation probably needs to be Portrait.  Don't ask why.

8.  You probably want to choose Bypass Tray. It might be also called
    Manual tray or something.

9.  Walk to the printer and find out where the bypass tray is (you
    might have to rtfm to find it). Then figure out how to load an
    envelope into it. Look for a diagram. Or you may have to rtfm
    again.

10. Walk back to your computer. You're done with the print preferences
    dialog now. Click OK.

11. You're back in the system print dialog. Click Print.

12. THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS LOL

And that is how you print on #10 business envelopes. In Windows. On a
giant fuckoff Ricoh multifunction color laser printer like you'd have
in a large office. Your mileage may vary on other printers. Don't ask
me about Macs or anything else, hipsters.
